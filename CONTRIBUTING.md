# Contributing to the Hungarian Etymological CLDF Dataset

Thank you for considering to contribute to this repository containing the results of my University of Vienna PhD project "Gothic loanwords in Hungarian"! This project aims to search for old Gothic loanwords in Hungarian. The input comes from three dictionaries: Two Hungarian etymological dictionaries: West Old Turkic (Róna-Tas and Berta 2011) and the New Hungarian Etymological Dictionary (Gerstner 2011-2022), and one Gothic dictionary (Köbler 2014). Two models were trained to predict how Hungarian words change as we travel back through time and how Gothic words change as they are adapted into ancient Hungarian. This repository contains the results of searching for phonetic and semantic overlaps between those predictions. Those are candidates for old Gothic loanwords in Hungarian.
