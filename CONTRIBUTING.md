# Contributing to the Hungarian Etymological CLDF Dataset

Thank you for considering to contribute to our Hungarian etymological data project! This project aims to convert some of the data from the "New Hungarian Etymological Dictionary" (Gerstner 2022) into the CLDF format. The dictionary contains modern Hungarian words as headwords, along with their etymological source language and year of first appearance in a written source. The oldest layer is inherited from Proto-Uralic, followed chronologically by Proto-Finno-Ugric and Proto-Ugric. The next oldest layer is borrowed from a Turkic language called West Old Turkic, or Proto-Bolgar. Standardising the way Hungarian etymologies are stored makes it easier to compare them with etymologies from other languages and facilitates various quantitative analyses that can lead to new insights about the origins of the Hungarian language.

## How to Contribute
