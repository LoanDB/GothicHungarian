Welcome to the GothicHungarian GitHub repository! This repository
contains Python scripts developed as part of my ongoing PhD thesis at
the University of Vienna. The repository is organised into three folders
containing Python scripts, raw data, and output data.

Repository Structure
--------------------

-  ``setup.py``: A setup file for installing the necessary packages and
   dependencies.
-  ``gothuncommands``: A folder containing all the Python scripts for
   data analysis.
-  ``raw``: A folder with raw data copied from two related repositories.
-  ``out``: A folder where the results go after running analyses with
   the scripts.

Related Repositories
--------------------

The raw data in this repository is based on the following repositories:

1. `gerstnerhungarian <https://github.com/LoanpyDataHub/gerstnerhungarian>`__
2. `koeblergothic <https://github.com/LoanpyDataHub/koeblergothic>`__
3. `ronataswestoldturkic <https://github.com/LoanpyDataHub/ronataswestoldturkic>`__

And much of the analysis is carried out with:

- `LoanPy <https://github.com/LoanpyDataHub/loanpy>`__
