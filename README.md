Welcome to the GothicHungarian GitHub repository! This repository contains Python scripts developed as part of my ongoing PhD thesis at the University of Vienna. The repository is organised into three folders containing Python scripts, raw data, and output data.

## Repository Structure

- `setup.py`: A setup file for installing the necessary packages and dependencies.
- `gothuncommands`: A folder containing all the Python scripts for data analysis.
- `raw`: A folder with raw data copied from two related repositories.
- `out`: A folder where the results go after running analyses with the scripts.

## Related Repositories

The raw data in this repository is based on the following repositories:

1. [gerstnerhungarian](https://github.com/LoanpyDataHub/gerstnerhungarian)
2. [koeblergothic](https://github.com/LoanpyDataHub/koeblergothic)
3. [ronataswestoldturkic](https://github.com/LoanpyDataHub/ronataswestoldturkic)

And much of the analysis is carried out with:

- [LoanPy](https://github.com/LoanpyDataHub/loanpy)
